On AWS in billing,
go to settings and add legacy reports, and have them dump to an S3 bucket

Create EC2 instance (I used a t2.large with 16 GiB space)

get splunk rpm on instance

run: sudo rpm -i <splunk-file>

move to /opt/splunk/bin
run: ./splunk start

get url and navigate to web

In splunk add apps 'Splunk App for AWS' and 'Splunk Add-on for AWS'
Restart splunk (either ./splunk restart from command line or Settings > Server Controls in GUI) 

In Splunk Add-on > Configuration: Add user with correct permissions

In Splunk Add-on > Inputs: [Create New Input]
Add Metadata, and Custom data type > Generic S3

Splunk can now search

For S3 bucket data, use search: index=* buckets

For budget data, use search: source="file name in S3 bucket" 
(I did a search of source=* then looked for the file name)
