IAM - Identity and Access Management
IAM is a whtielist of users with access to your AWS files. It can use Active Directory
or other authenticators instead of mantaining a manual list. Users default to no
access, which is called explict deny. Like *nix systems, work via a user acount is a
best pratice instead of working via root. Billing is tied to the root account, but
permission can be given to other users. AWS policies set permissions which can be assigned to
groups or users. They can be created using the AWS tool or via a JSON file.

AWS Networking Services
VPCs are Virtual private clouds and similar to VPNs in that they don't allow default
outside access. VPCs are within AWS and encompass Availability Zones, but Subnets
within the VPN are created with AZs. If you wish to share resources or data between
VPCs, then you'll need to pair them. PAired subnets use a low latency connection and
must have different IP address ranges.

Network Access Control List is the Subnets firewall. NACL allows both whitelists and
blacklists to control access. The rules for NACL are sequential. Security groups apply
to instances and allow only whitelists.

Network Address Translation gateway allows private instances to access the internet,
while outside services cannot access the private instances. Instances of NAT can be
controlled by the user, while the NAT Gateway is controlled by the cloud provider.
