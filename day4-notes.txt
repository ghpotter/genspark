RDS - Cloud DB

Many options on type of DB and cost structures (We stuck with using MySQL)

Steps to creating a private DB and connecting it with a public instance:
 - Create a custom VPC
 - Create 2 subnets. One will be private for the DB, and one will be public for the instance
 - Create 2 route tables. Again, one for private DB and one for public instance
 - Create an Internet gateway for the public instance
 - Create instance on EC2 in the public subnet
 - Create DB in RDS in the private subnet
 - Create Security group for the instance as a nested Security Group in the DB. The Security Group must allow a connection to the instance's private IP.

Assigenment at end of class:
- Add an application to the instance that connects to the private DB.
