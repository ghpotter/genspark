amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
- Installs Amazon packages. For this were are focused on Cloudwatch Agent.
- EPEL = Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux
- 

yum install stress -y (for stress testing)

Simple Notification Service (SNS)
 - Regional Service
 - create subscription after creating service
 
 Cloudwatch - Monitoring service
 - Select instance -> Select metric
 - Configure Actions -> Set Alarm to service created in SNS
 Theory:
 - Moditors applications (logs) and resources (CPU, Memory, Storage, Network)
 - Create Dashboards or Alarms
 - Alarms can trigger SNS
 - Namespace: Container (placeholder)
 - Types of Alarm:
  - OK: Metric is within threshold
  - Alarm: Metric is outside threshold
  - Inssufficent data: Not enough data from metric
  - Pricing - Depends on usage, like other cloud services

Adding Memory monitor to ec2:
 - Create IAM role with Cloudwatch Agent access (CloudwatchFullAccess) and assign to instance (You can modify an existing role and add the CloudWatchFullAccess policy also)
 - SSH into your instance
 - Install Agent: yum install amazon-cloudwatch-agent -y
 - Install collectD: yum install collectD -y (needed otherwise fetch-config throws an error)
 - Run configure wizard:
  - cd /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin
  - ./amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard and answer questions
  - OR use nano to write the following to config.JSON:

{
        "agent": {
                "metrics_collection_interval": 60,
                "run_as_user": "root"
        },
        "metrics": {
                "metrics_collected": {
                        "mem": {
                                "measurement": [
                                        "mem_used_percent"
                                ],
                                "metrics_collection_interval": 60
                        }
                },
        }
}
 - this configuration polls the memory used as a percentage every 60 seconds
 - Configure and start agent: ./amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -s -c file:config.json
 - Go to CloudWatch and create an Alarm, you should see a new namespace name CWAgent with the mem_used_percent metric in it.
 
stress for memory (The standard EC2 instance has 1 GB memory so this should use half of that):
 - stress --vm-bytes 500M -t 600 -m 1
